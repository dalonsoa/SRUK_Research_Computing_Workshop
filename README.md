# About the Workshop

Welcome to this second event of the SRUK Research Computing Workshop series, devoted to Python. Python is programming language that has become one of the dominant tools in research and teaching thanks to its flexibility, simplicity, and enormous supporting community. Specifically, this hands-on workshop will cover the following content:

- Brief introduction to the basics
- Overview of Python packages and developing your own libraries
- Numerical computation with [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- Data science with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Professional-looking figures with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

This workshop is at a beginners-intermediate level. Although there will be an introduction to basic Python, we will not linger over it for too long and will move soon to more advanced – and useful – stuff. Even though we will not go through very complicated examples, you are more than welcome to go through some basic Python concepts on your own prior to the workshop (e.g., check the first half of the content provided [here](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/python-novice-mix/)) and get the most out of this training!

Join this event if you want to…

- Create your own libraries of recurrent functions and tools you will be using to analyse your data.
- Analyse your data, fitting it to complex functions using powerful algorithms or exploring their statistical properties.
- Learn how to easily generate publication-quality figures.

If time allows, at the end of the workshop we will provide tips and resources for those wanting to expand their knowledge on other topics such as differential equation solving, parallel computing, machine learning, and deep learning.
