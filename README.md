# About the Workshop

Welcome to this second event of the SRUK Research Computing Workshop series, devoted to Python. Python is programming language that has become one of the dominant tools in research and teaching thanks to its flexibility, simplicity, and enormous supporting community. Specifically, this hands-on workshop will cover the following content:

- Brief introduction to the basics
- Overview of Python packages and developing your own libraries
- Numerical computation with [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- Data science with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Professional-looking figures with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

This workshop is at a beginners-intermediate level. Although there will be an introduction to basic Python, we will not linger over it for too long and will move soon to more advanced – and useful – stuff. Even though we will not go through very complicated examples, you are more than welcome to go through some basic Python concepts on your own prior to the workshop (e.g., check the first half of the content provided [here](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/python-novice-mix/)) and get the most out of this training!

Join this event if you want to…

- Create your own libraries of recurrent functions and tools you will be using to analyse your data.
- Analyse your data, fitting it to complex functions using powerful algorithms or exploring their statistical properties.
- Learn how to easily generate publication-quality figures.

If time allows, at the end of the workshop we will provide tips and resources for those wanting to expand their knowledge on other topics such as differential equation solving, parallel computing, machine learning, and deep learning.

# Setting up the environment

The aim of this workshop is to provide you with the fundamental knowledge of the tools you will need to exploit Python in your research. We want you to code along with us, to try things and ask questions whenever you don't get the expected results. Chances are that other colleagues will be on the same situation.

To make this as user friendly as possible, we will use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). In the [lessons folder](lessons) you can find the Jupyter Notebooks we have prepared. Notebooks combine text and explanations (including equations written in Latex, if needed) with executable code and its output, being this a bunch of numbers, some texts or plots. For this reason, it is becoming quite popular in the teaching environment. The [final section of this document](#using-jupyter-lab-and-notebooks)

We strongly encourage you to install Python and all the relevant dependencies locally in your computer. However, if you prefer not to - at least not yet - that's OK. Keep reading to the next subsection.
