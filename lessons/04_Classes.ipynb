    "**Questions:**\n",
    "- What is a class?\n",
    "- How do I create a class?\n",
    "- How do I use classes in my programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "- Describe what encapsulation means\n",
    "- Differentiate between classes and object instances\n",
    "- Describe what instance attributes and methods are\n",
    "- Describe what class attributes are\n",
    "- Create classes in Python\n",
    "- Use methods and attributes in a program\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "- Any object in Python is an instance - i.e. a concrete realization - of a class\n",
    "- A class combines attributes and behaviors that have some conceptual relationship with each other"

    "# What's Object Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Object Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a programming paradigm in which the flow of a program is controlled by the exchange of information and modification of the state of individual units called *objects*.\n",
    "- These objects bundle together properties and behaviors that have some relationship with each other.\n",
    "- In many aspects, OOP mimics how real-life objects are and interact with each other.\n",
    "- Python is a multi-paradigm programing language, meaning it can be used in OOP, but also in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [procedureal programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), etc. (very often) mixing them to achieve different purposes on differt parts of the program."

    "- Encapsulation enables a class to present an interface on how an object belonging to that class (see below) can be acted upon, hiding from the outside world any implementation details and other properties that need not to be known outside that class.\n",
    "- All variables and functions defined within a class that are not attributes or methods are not accessible outside of the class.\n",
