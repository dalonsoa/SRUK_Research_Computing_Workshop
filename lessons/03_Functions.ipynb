    "- What are functions?\n",
    "- How do you call a function?\n",
    "- Do functions always return a value?\n",
    "- How many arguments do functions have?\n",
    "- Can you create your own functions?\n",

    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "- Describe what functions are\n",
    "- Differentiate between positional arguments and keyword arguments\n",
    "- Use existing functions\n",
    "- Create functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "- Functions encapsulate bits of code that are likely to be reused several times\n",
    "- Functions must be correctly documented to inform the user what they do\n",
    "- Ideally, functions should do one thing, and one thing only"

    "- Functions might be called with 0, 1, 2 or as many arguments as required (see below).\n",
    "- But they **ALWAYS** return something, even if it is just the object `None`. "
